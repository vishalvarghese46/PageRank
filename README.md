# PageRank

A simple version of Google's page rank algorithm. The code spiders the web, reterives some url, calculate a page rank and visualizes the links between the reterieved urls.

Execution pattern:

1. RUN spider.py and enter a link. The program will prompt for the number of pages urls you would like for it to reterieve.

2. RUN sprank.py which calculates the rank for the urls based on the link between the url.

3. RUN spjson to create the visualization json for the top ranked url's 

4. RUN force.html to visulize the top ranked url of your web crawl.
